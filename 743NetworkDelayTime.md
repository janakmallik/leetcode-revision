# Network Delay Time - Solution Explanation

## Problem Statement
You are given a **directed weighted graph** with `n` nodes (labeled `1` to `n`). The edges are represented as `times[i] = (u, v, w)`, meaning there is a **directed edge** from `u` to `v` with a travel time `w`.

You need to find the **minimum time** for all nodes to receive a signal sent from a given starting node `k`. If some nodes **cannot** receive the signal, return `-1`.

## Approach
The problem can be solved using **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**, which is efficient for finding the shortest path in a **weighted directed graph**.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Build an Adjacency List:** Convert the `times` list into a graph representation.
2. **Use Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:** Use a **min-heap (priority queue)** to always expand the node with the shortest known distance.
3. **Track distances:** Maintain a dictionary to store the shortest time taken to reach each node.
4. **Return the maximum shortest distance:** The final result is the longest shortest distance among all reachable nodes.

## Adjacency List Representation
Instead of using an adjacency matrix (which takes O(NÂ²) space), we use an **adjacency list** to store only the **existing edges** efficiently.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

graph = defaultdict(list)
for u, v, w in times:
    graph[u].append((v, w))  # u â†’ (v, weight w)
```

### Example:
If `times = [[2,1,1], [2,3,1], [3,4,1]]`, the adjacency list will be:
```python
{
    2: [(1, 1), (3, 1)],
    3: [(4, 1)]
}
```

## Implementation
```python
from typing import List
from heapq import heappop, heappush
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Build the adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u].append((v, w))

        # Step 2: Use Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
        heap = [(0, k)]  # (travel time, node)
        shortest_time = {}
        
        while heap:
            time, node = heappop(heap)  # Get node with the shortest known time
            
            if node in shortest_time:
                continue  # If we already processed this node, skip it
            
            shortest_time[node] = time  # Record shortest time to reach this node
            
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in shortest_time:
                    heappush(heap, (time + weight, neighbor))  # Push next node
        
        # Step 3: Check if all nodes are reached
        if len(shortest_time) == n:
            return max(shortest_time.values())  # Max time among all reachable nodes
        return -1  # If some nodes are not reached
```

## Time Complexity Analysis
### **Building the Graph**
- We iterate over `times` once: **O(E)**, where `E` is the number of edges.

### **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
- Each node is processed **once**: O(N) in the worst case.
- Each edge is **relaxed** once: O(E log N) (log N comes from using a heap).

### **Total Complexity**
**O(E log N)** (Efficient for large graphs)

---

## Space Complexity Analysis
- **Adjacency List:** O(N + E)
- **Min-Heap:** O(N)
- **Distance Dictionary:** O(N)
- **Total Space:** **O(N + E)**

---

## Edge Cases Considered
1. **Single Node Graph** â†’ No edges, return `0`.
2. **Disconnected Nodes** â†’ If some nodes are not reachable, return `-1`.
3. **Multiple Paths** â†’ Algorithm ensures the shortest path is chosen.
4. **Large `n` (100) & `E` (6000)** â†’ Handled efficiently using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.

## Summary
âœ… **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** is optimal for this problem.  
âœ… **Adjacency List** ensures efficient graph representation.  
âœ… **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** helps process shortest paths first.  
âœ… **O(E log N) complexity** ensures it runs efficiently for large inputs.
